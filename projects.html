              <h1><u>Helping Users Make Sense of their Social Networks</u></h1>
              <p>For my honours project in my final year of university, I created a web application which allowed a user to visualise, interact, and explore the network of a Twitter account. Users were able to view details such as the different communities within the network as well as being able to view the political ideologies of each account in the network. The aim of this project was to allow users to better understand their social networks, while also aiming to provide an application that could help to prevent the formation of echo chambers online.  </p>
              <p>The tools used in the development of this project were JavaScript and the D3.js library for creating an interactive visualisation. The Twitter API and Python were used for data collection. Network analysis and political sentiment analysis were achieved using Python and the NetworkX library. Finally, the Flask framework was used to create an API that allowed the processed Twitter data to be accessed by the JavaScript.   </p>
              <p>Throughout this project I developed my time and project management skills as working to deadlines was vital for the project to stay on track and be finished in time for submission. The project also allowed me to develop my skills in software and web development by introducing me to technologies and techniques I was unfamiliar with such as the creation of an API, visualisation libraries, cloud computing, and political sentiment analysis. This project achieved the highest grade in the year, and I was extremely pleased with how it turned out.  </p>

              <h1><u>Industry Project for Theo Health</u></h1>
              <p>During the first few weeks of fourth year, students were assigned to groups to work on a project for the health-tech startup Theo Health. Groups were given a small brief, with the objective of the project being to create a web application which took sensor values and returned a heatmap superimposed onto a human body structure.  </p>
              <p>The group decided to implement an agile approach to development, with weekly sprints and user stories. My role within the group was back-end development. I was responsible for the creation and maintenance of the web applications mySQL database, in addition to the development of all PHP and SQL code.  </p>
              <p>This project allowed me to develop my teamwork and communication skills in addition to providing experience of working with a real client. The group achieved a grade of an A2, with my personal grade being increased to the highest possible grade of an A1 after a peer review from my fellow group members. </p>

              <h1><u>Troll Slayer</u></h1>
              <p>In my third year of University I took a game design module. In this module
              students had to design and make a game of their choice. I chose to make a 2D platformer called Troll Slayer using the Godot Engine.
              Troll Slayer is based around platforming and boss fights. It used the Entity Component System design pattern, the singleton design pattern, and the game loop design pattern.</p>

              <h1><u>Agile Web Development Project</u></h1>
              <p>In my third year of university I took an agile software development module. Within this module students were put into small agile teams and given clients which had multiple requirements and software for the team to develop. First the group assigned roles to the members, such as scrum master, product owner and developer. After this we asked the clients what they wanted from their software and broke these up into different user stories. Then using different techniques such as tshirt sizing and planning poker we assigned each story a value and determined which stories we would complete in the first sprint. We then implemented these stories within one week. First making a form system similiar to google forms. Then in the second sprint we added a user system and a transcript annotation system. Overall this project did really well and recieved an A grade. Since we had to self host, the website is no longer live as we ran out of money! however you can check out the github below. </p>

              <h1><u>Research assignment on the relationship between drugs and their side effects</u></h1>
              <p>As part of one of my second year university modules, students were given the task of coming up with a project and creating a presentation on the work we did. When researching online, I found a very interesting data set containing a series of medical drugs and their related side effects. Using python and the snap framework I wrote some code to generate graphs to show the relationships between certain drugs and their side effects. I created a quick webpage to show the findings of the research which can be visited by clicking the link below</p>

              <h1><u>Lyric finder website</u></h1>
              <p>As part of my Advanced Higher Computing Science course a student had to create a web application that had a front and back end. I chose to create a site that allowed a user to find a song name from song lyrics. The website would take the users input and compare it to a database filled with lyrics. If the user inputed data matched part of a lyric it would then show the user the song, the album and the artist their lyric was from. I used HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL to create this website. </p>

              <p>As part of one of my second year university modules students were tasked with creating an ATM simulator that showed examples of a data race and non data race condition when taking out money from the same account at the same time. The non-data race mode would utilise a lock we implemented and the non
              data race would not. </p>
